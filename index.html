      The project revolved around mapping data for accidents involving bikers
      and cyclists. The data is retrived from NYC Open Data. I thought that
      people were more likely to get into an accident during the summer seasons
      because more people will go outside when it is warmer. I used folium to
      aid in the mapping and pandas to help scarpe the data from the csv files
      obtained from NYC Open Data. I created a web map to visualize the
      accidents that happen throughout NYC. Red indicates a fatality and Orange
      indicates an injury to a cyclist.

      The data sets I used are
      <a
        href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bicycle-Routes/7vsa-caz7"
      >
        Bike routes data</a
      >
      which shows the bike routes created in NYC that will be visualized in the
      web map in a dark green color. The other data I used is the
      <a

      >
        motor vehicle collision data
      </a>
      which has all data for accidents involving a vehicle in NYC
